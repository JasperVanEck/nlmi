Your final grade in this course will depend on weekly assignments (code and theory exercises, as well as a report) and exams (midterm and final).


# Assignments (50%)

## Practicals (30%)

There are 5 weekly practicals, each of which contributes 6% to your final grade in this course, thus together they will account for 30% of your final grade.

## Report (20%)

Throughout the course you will work on a report, there will be checkpoints where you will submit partial progress and received feedback from your TA. The final report will represent 20% of your final grade in this course.


# Exams (50%)

We have two exams:

* the midterm will cover the content presented in the first 3 weeks of the course and represents 20% of your final grade in the course
* the final exam may cover the complete content of the course and represents 30% of your final grade in the course.

# Final grade

Each component is summarised in a component grade via a simple weighted average of the points your earned throughout the course, normalised to a 10 points scale, and rounded to nearest half-point. 

**But note that to pass this course** both components (exam and assignments) must be at least 5.

In case one or both of your components is less than 5, you will need a resit. 

In case both components are 5 or more, your final grade will be a simple average:

\begin{equation}
f = 0.5 \times e + 0.5 \times a
\end{equation}

where $$e$$ is your exam component and $$a$$ your assignments component. Your grade $$f$$ will be rounded to the nearest half-point.


# Resit

If you haven't scored the minimum necessary to pass the course (according to the criteria above), you will need a resit. Your resit grade will substitute only one of your components (the smallest) and your updated grade after the resit will again be a simple waited average:

\begin{equation}
u = 0.5 \times \max(e, a) + 0.5 \times \max(r, \min(e, a))
\end{equation} 

where $$u$$ is your udpated grade, $$e$$ is your exam component, $$a$$ is your assignments component, and $$r$$ is your resit grade (normalised to a 10 points scale). Your grade $$u$$ will be rounded to the nearest half-point.

**Note that** if you need a resit you should prepare to answer questions covering the complete content of the course.
