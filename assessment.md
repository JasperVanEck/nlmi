Every week you work on lab assignments with two types of exercises (practice and theory). Each exercise is worth a certain number of points (indicated in the exercise's description).

# Practice

Most weeks you earn practice points $$p_i$$ computed as follows (for convenience we scale it to 10):

\begin{equation}
p_i = 10 \times \frac{\text{points achieved}}{\text{points possible}} 
\end{equation}

Your final grade for practice is 

\begin{equation}
    p = \frac{1}{n_p} \sum_{i=1}^{n_p} p_i
\end{equation}

where $$n_{p}$$ is the total number of practice assignments.

# Theory

Most weeks you earn theory points $$t_i$$ computed just like before (again we scale it to 10)

\begin{equation}
t_i = 10 \times \frac{\text{points achieved}}{\text{points possible}} 
\end{equation}

Your final grade for theory is 

\begin{equation}
    t = \frac{1}{n_t} \sum_{i=1}^{n_t} t_i
\end{equation}

where $$n_{t}$$ is the total number of theory assignments.

# Exam and Final Grade

We have a single exam at the end of the course, and we denote by $e$ the points you earn

\begin{equation}
e = 10 \times \frac{\text{points achieved}}{\text{points possible}} 
\end{equation}

Your final grade $$g$$ is a weighted average where the exam counts 40%, practice counts 40%, and theory counts 20%:

\begin{equation}
    g = 0.4 \times e + 0.4\times p + 0.2 \times t
\end{equation}


*You will have to score at least 5 in each criterion in order to pass this course.*
