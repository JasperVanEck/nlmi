Your final grade in this course will depend on weekly assignments (code and theory exercises, as well as a report) and exams (midterm and final).


# Assignments (50%)

## Practicals (30%)

There are 5 weekly practicals, each of which contributes 6% to your final grade in this course, thus together they will account for 30% of your final grade.

## Report (20%)

Throughout the course you will work on a report, there will be checkpoints where you will submit partial progress and received feedback from your TA. The final report will represent 20% of your final grade in this course.


# Exams (50%)

We have two exams:

* the midterm will cover the content presented in the first 3 weeks of the course and represents 20% of your final grade in the course
* the final exam may cover the complete content of the course and represents 30% of your final grade in the course.

# Final grade

The final grade is a simple weighted average of the points you earned throughout the course, normalised to a 10 points scale, and rounded to nearest half-point. 

**But note that to pass this course**

* you must score at least 50% of the points available in the exam component 
* you must score at least 50% of the points available in the assignment component
    * and within the assignment component, you must score at least 50% of the points available for the report

In case any of these constraints are not satisfied, your grade will be the smallest of the three.
