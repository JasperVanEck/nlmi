Every week you work on lab assignments with two types of exercises (practice and theory). Each exercise is worth a certain number of points (indicated in the exercise's description).

* $$p_i$$ is the practice points you earn in week $$i$$ and it is computed as follows (for convenience we scale it to 10):

\begin{equation}
p_i = 10 \times \frac{\text{points achieved}}{\text{points possible}} 
\end{equation}

* $$t_i$$ is the theory points you earn in week $$i$$ and it is computed just like before (again we scale it to 10)

\begin{equation}
t_i = 10 \times \frac{\text{points achieved}}{\text{points possible}} 
\end{equation}

* $$e$$ is the points you earn in the final exam

\begin{equation}
e = 10 \times \frac{\text{points achieved}}{\text{points possible}} 
\end{equation}

Your final grade $$g$$ is a weighted average where the exam counts 40%, practice counts 40%, and theory counts 20%:

\begin{equation}
    g = 0.4 \times e + \frac{1}{w} \left( \sum_{i=1}^w 0.4\times p_i + 0.2 \times t_i \right)
\end{equation}

where $$w$$ is the total number of lab assignments.
