Your final grade in this course will depend on weekly assignments (code and theory exercises, as well as a report) and exams (midterm and final).


# Assignments (50%)

## Practicals (30%)

There are 5 weekly practicals, each of which contributes 6% to your final grade in this course, thus together they will account for 30% of your final grade.

## Report (20%)

Throughout the course you will work on a report, there will be checkpoints where you will submit partial progress and received feedback from your TA. The final report will represent 20% of your final grade in this course.


# Exams (50%)

We have two exams:

* the midterm will cover the content presented in the first 3 weeks of the course and represents 20% of your final grade in the course
* the final exam may cover the complete content of the course and represents 30% of your final grade in the course.

# Final grade

Each component is summarised in a component grade via a simple weighted average of the points your earned throughout the course, normalised to a 10 points scale, and rounded to nearest half-point. 

**But note that to pass this course** both components (exam and assignments) must be at least 5.


In case your exam component is less than 5
* you can opt for a resit, however, for this to be possible both your assignments component and your report grade must be at least 5

In case either your report grade or your assignments component is less than 5, you have failed the course.


# Resit

Your resit grade can only substitute the exam component. 

**Note that** if you need a resit you should prepare to answer questions covering the complete content of the course.
